# Mapbox Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Framework Selection and Planning
- **Selected Mapbox GL JS** as the replacement for the custom SVG-based mapping system
- **Analyzed existing system** and identified all components that needed migration
- **Created comprehensive task breakdown** for the migration process

### 2. Package Configuration
- **Updated package.json** to replace Leaflet dependencies with Mapbox dependencies:
  - Removed: `leaflet`, `@types/leaflet`
  - Added: `mapbox-gl`, `react-map-gl`, `@types/mapbox-gl`

### 3. New Mapbox Component Created
- **Built MapboxInteractiveMap component** (`src/components/maps/MapboxInteractiveMap.tsx`)
- **Features implemented**:
  - Interactive vector maps with professional styling
  - UPSC-relevant location markers with detailed popups
  - Search and filtering functionality
  - Layer management (states, rivers, mountains, parks)
  - AI assistant integration panel
  - Mobile-responsive controls
  - Zoom, pan, and fullscreen controls

### 4. Enhanced Data Structure
- **Created mapboxMapData.ts** with GeoJSON-based data structure
- **Implemented comprehensive layers**:
  - Rivers Layer: Major river systems with educational data
  - States Layer: Political geography and capitals
  - Mountains Layer: Physical geography features
  - National Parks Layer: Biodiversity and conservation data
  - Heritage Sites Layer: Historical and cultural monuments
- **Educational metadata** for each feature:
  - UPSC relevance and exam frequency
  - Syllabus topics and key facts
  - Importance levels and categories

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Created comprehensive test suite** (`src/components/maps/__tests__/MapboxInteractiveMap.test.tsx`)
- **Test coverage includes**:
  - Component rendering and props
  - Control panel functionality
  - AI assistant integration
  - Layer filtering and search
  - Mobile responsiveness

### 6. Documentation
- **Created MAPBOX_SETUP.md** with detailed setup instructions
- **Installation script** (`install-mapbox.sh`) for easy dependency management
- **Environment configuration** guidance for Mapbox tokens

### 7. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed useDictionary.ts export issue** that was causing compilation errors
- **Resolved syntax errors** in the dictionary hook

## üîÑ Current Status

### Temporary Fallback
The maps page is currently using the **original InteractiveMap component** as a fallback while the Mapbox dependencies are being installed. This ensures the application continues to work without errors.

### Dependencies Installation
The Mapbox dependencies need to be properly installed. The package.json has been updated, but the actual npm installation encountered system issues.

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Migration

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the installation script or manually install:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the provided script
./install-mapbox.sh

# Option 2: Manual installation
npm install mapbox-gl@^3.7.0 react-map-gl@^7.1.7 @types/mapbox-gl@^3.4.0
```

### 2. Get Mapbox Access Token
1. Sign up at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
2. Get your access token from [account.mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com)
3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.your_actual_token_here
   ```

### 3. Switch to Mapbox Component
Update `src/app/maps/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change from:
import InteractiveMap from '@/components/maps/InteractiveMap';

// To:
import MapboxInteractiveMap from '@/components/maps/MapboxInteractiveMap';

// And update the component usage:
<MapboxInteractiveMap
  height="500px"
  initialCenter={[78.9629, 20.5937]}
  initialZoom={5}
  showControls={true}
  showAIAssistant={true}
/>
```

### 4. Test the Implementation
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/maps` page
3. Verify all features work correctly:
   - Map loads and displays properly
   - Markers appear for UPSC locations
   - Search and filtering work
   - Popups show educational information
   - Controls are responsive

### 5. Optional Enhancements
Once basic functionality is working:
- **Custom map styles** for better educational visualization
- **Additional data layers** (climate zones, economic regions)
- **Enhanced AI integration** for location-based queries
- **Offline map support** for study without internet

## üéØ Benefits of Migration

### Educational Advantages
- **Professional mapping**: Better visual quality and user experience
- **Rich educational data**: Comprehensive UPSC-relevant information
- **Interactive learning**: Engaging exploration of geographic concepts
- **Exam preparation**: Direct connection to syllabus topics and exam frequency

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated vector rendering
- **Scalability**: Efficient loading and smooth interactions
- **Mobile optimization**: Better touch controls and responsiveness
- **Future-ready**: Modern architecture for AI integration

### Maintenance Benefits
- **Industry standard**: Using established mapping framework
- **Community support**: Large ecosystem and documentation
- **Regular updates**: Continuous improvements and security patches
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and customizations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependencies not installing**: Try clearing npm cache and reinstalling
2. **Map not loading**: Check Mapbox token configuration
3. **Blank map**: Verify token permissions and internet connection
4. **Performance issues**: Check browser compatibility and hardware acceleration

### Support Resources
- **Mapbox Documentation**: [docs.mapbox.com](https://docs.mapbox.com)
- **React Map GL**: [visgl.github.io/react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl)
- **UPSC Dashboard Setup**: See `MAPBOX_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
