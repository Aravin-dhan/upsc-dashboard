    question: 'With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:\n1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee.\n2. An increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.\n3. An increase in trade deficit means a decrease in the current account deficit.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?',

    correctAnswer: '1 only',
    explanation: 'Statement 1 is correct: NEER measures the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies. An increase indicates appreciation. Statement 2 is incorrect: An increase in REER indicates a loss of trade competitiveness as domestic goods become relatively expensive. Statement 3 is incorrect: Trade deficit is a component of current account deficit, so an increase in trade deficit would increase current account deficit.',
