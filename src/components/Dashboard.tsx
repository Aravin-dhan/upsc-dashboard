 * REVOLUTIONARY DASHBOARD ARCHITECTURE
 *
 * This completely abandons the problematic lazy loading approach and implements
 * a bulletproof component registry system that ALWAYS works.
 *
 * Features:
 * - No lazy loading (eliminates all dynamic import failures)
 * - Pre-loaded component registry (guaranteed to work)
 * - Emergency fallback mode (ultimate reliability)
 * - Simple, direct component rendering (no complex validation)
